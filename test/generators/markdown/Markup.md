Markup

Module `Markup`

Here, we test the rendering of comment markup.

# Sections

Let's get these done first, because sections will be used to break up the rest of this test.

Besides the section heading above, there are also

## Subsection headings

and

### Sub-subsection headings

but odoc has banned deeper headings. There are also title headings, but they are only allowed in mld files.

### Anchors

Sections can have attached [Anchors](#anchors), and it is possible to [link](#anchors) to them. Links to section headers should not be set in source code style.

#### Paragraph

Individual paragraphs can have a heading.

##### Subparagraph

Parts of a longer paragraph that can be considered alone can also have headings.

# Styling

This paragraph has some styled elements: **bold** and _italic_, **_bold italic_**, _emphasis_, __emphasis_ within emphasis_, **_bold italic_**, super<sup>script</sup>, sub<sub>script</sub>. The line spacing should be enough for superscripts and subscripts not to look odd.

Note: _In italics _emphasis_ is rendered as normal text while _emphasis _in_ emphasis_ is rendered in italics._ _It also work the same in [links in italics with _emphasis _in_ emphasis_.](#)_

`code` is a different kind of markup that doesn't allow nested markup.

It's possible for two markup elements to appear **next** _to_ each other and have a space, and appear **next**_to_ each other with no space. It doesn't matter **how** _much_ space it was in the source: in this sentence, it was two space characters. And in this one, there is **a** _newline_.

This is also true between _non-_`code` markup _and_ `code`.

Code can appear **inside `other` markup**. Its display shouldn't be affected.

# Links and references

This is a [link](#). It sends you to the top of this page. Links can have markup inside them: [**bold**](#), [_italics_](#), [_emphasis_](#), [super<sup>script</sup>](#), [sub<sub>script</sub>](#), and [`code`](#). Links can also be nested _[inside](#)_ markup. Links cannot be nested inside each other. This link has no replacement text: [#](#). The text is filled in by odoc. This is a shorthand link: [#](#). The text is also filled in by odoc in this case.

This is a reference to [`foo`](#val-foo). References can have replacement text: [the value foo](#val-foo). Except for the special lookup support, references are pretty much just like links. The replacement text can have nested styles: [**bold**](#val-foo), [_italic_](#val-foo), [_emphasis_](#val-foo), [super<sup>script</sup>](#val-foo), [sub<sub>script</sub>](#val-foo), and [`code`](#val-foo). It's also possible to surround a reference in a style: **[`foo`](#val-foo)**. References can't be nested inside references, and links and references can't be nested inside each other.

# Preformatted text

This is a code block:

```
let foo = ()
(** There are some nested comments in here, but an unpaired comment
    terminator would terminate the whole doc surrounding comment. It's
    best to keep code blocks no wider than 72 characters. *)

let bar =
  ignore foo
```
There are also verbatim blocks:

```
The main difference is these don't get syntax highlighting.
```
# Lists

- This is a
  

- shorthand bulleted list,
  

- and the paragraphs in each list item support _styling_.
  

1. This is a
   

2. shorthand numbered list.
   

- Shorthand list items can span multiple lines, however trying to put two paragraphs into a shorthand list item using a double line break
  

just creates a paragraph outside the list.

- Similarly, inserting a blank line between two list items
  

- creates two separate lists.
  

- To get around this limitation, one
  
  can use explicitly-delimited lists.
  

- This one is bulleted,
  

1. but there is also the numbered variant.
   

- - lists
    
  
  - can be nested
    
  
  - and can include references
    
  
  - [`foo`](#val-foo)
    
  

# Unicode

The parser supports any ASCII-compatible encoding, in particuÎ»ar UTF-8.

# Raw HTML

Raw HTML can be <input type="text" placeholder="inserted"> as inline elements into sentences.


    <blockquote>
      If the raw HTML is the only thing in a paragraph, it is treated as a block
      element, and won't be wrapped in paragraph tags by the HTML generator.
    </blockquote>
