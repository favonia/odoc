Stop

Module `Stop`

This test cases exercises stop comments.

<a id="val-foo"></a>

###### val foo :

> int

This is normal commented text.

The next value is `bar`, and it should be missing from the documentation.
There is also an entire module, `M`, which should also be hidden. It contains
a nested stop comment, but that stop comment should not turn documentation
back on in this outer module, because stop comments respect scope.

Documentation is on again.

Now, we have a nested module, and it has a stop comment between its two
items. We want to see that the first item is displayed, but the second is
missing, and the stop comment disables documenation only in that module, and
not in this outer module.

<a id="module-N"></a>

###### module [N](Stop.N.md)

<a id="val-lol"></a>

###### val lol :

> int
